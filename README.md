# SleepReport

This is a Python code used to evaluate sleep.

The program accepts inputs from the user about sleep details like target hours of sleep, minimum percentage for a 'good' night, and the number of light, deep, REM, and awake hours per night. It then displays a summary report for the percentage of nights both goals were achieved followed by information pertaining to the 'best night.'
